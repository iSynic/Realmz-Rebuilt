# Runtime contract mirror

## Purpose

Mirror the authoritative Providence `.realmz2` schemas byte-for-byte and expose drift verification to the runtime repository.

## Ownership

- JSON Schemas and explicit format/version identifiers consumed by the runtime.
- Mirror hashes and schema-drift checks.

## Local Contracts

- Providence is authoritative. Changes originate there, are reviewed with its exporter, then are mirrored without hand edits.
- Schema files use canonical UTF-8 bytes and deterministic ordering.
- Runtime package fixtures are synthetic and contain no commercial payloads.

## Work Guidance

- Record the matching Providence commit and schema SHA-256 when updating the mirror.
- Schema v1 currently mirrors Providence `bb300fe8795604e5b288eee41b82f819a13eb951` at SHA-256 `dd3c467b9dc3fe61574a2809c43e9c28f38c7e5d4fee98a547dfcd9da95dfe2b`.

## Verification

- CI compares the mirrored schema hash to the Providence-authoritative expected hash when that checkout/artifact is available.
- Package validation tests exercise every schema revision in use.

## Child DOX Index

- No child AGENTS.md files are currently required.
