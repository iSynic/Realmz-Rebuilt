# Scenario execution contract

## Purpose

Own the serializable Scenario VM, Classic instructions, Safe Scenario Actions, capabilities, and the single Realmz runtime API presented by a session.

## Ownership

- VM instruction/frame/trace/limit models and execution.
- Classic AP, XAP, encounter, GOSUB, return, and result semantics.
- Scenario Action definitions, validated Safe programs, private helpers, state schemas, and migrations.
- Capability declarations and readiness checks.

## Local Contracts

- The VM is presentation-independent and serializable at every interaction yield.
- Domain mutations execute through one session-owned `RealmzRuntimeApi`; there are no Godot ports or dynamic GDScript fallbacks.
- Classic GOSUB depth is 20. Safe Action call depth is 32, program size 4,096 nodes, arrays 256 entries, and execution 65,536 steps.
- Unknown instructions, IDs, capabilities, actions, and response shapes fail explicitly.
- Packages cannot override `realmz.*`; campaign actions use `scenario.<campaign>.*`.
- A Scenario Action call is an ordinary AP/Encounter timeline entry. Authoring gaps and behavior anchors are not runtime concepts.
- Runtime instruction forms are preserved `ClassicAction` records and typed `CallScenarioAction` records. Safe bytecode is compiler output, never Providence editor state.
- The session owns the active VM, action state, runtime API, and post-move continuation. VM snapshots include Classic and Safe frames, origin, trace, and any pending typed interaction.

## Work Guidance

- Preserve raw and normalized Classic opcode identity plus source provenance.
- Represent player input as an `InteractionRequest` and resume the exact issuing frame.
- Keep Safe Action source and visual outline as two views of the same validated program.

## Verification

- VM tests cover calls, returns, limits, yields, save/resume, unknown behavior, and Castle traces.

## Child DOX Index

- No child AGENTS.md files are currently required.
